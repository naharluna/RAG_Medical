# 🏥 Medical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for answering **medical queries** using large language models (LLMs) with context retrieved from a domain-specific medical knowledge base.

---

## 📌 Overview

The notebook implements a medical question-answering system using a RAG approach. It enhances the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLMs by grounding responses in retrieved, relevant medical documents. This system is ideal for use in medical assistants, healthbots, or educational research tools.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Loads and processes medical documents
- ✅ Embeds documents using pre-trained embedding models
- ✅ Uses FAISS or ChromaDB for vector-based similarity search
- ✅ Retrieves top-k relevant documents based on user queries
- ✅ Generates answers using an LLM with augmented context
- ✅ Clean and modular Jupyter Notebook-based prototype

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Document Ingestion**  
   Medical texts (PDFs, DOCs, or TXT) are loaded and split into chunks.

2. **Embedding Generation**  
   Each chunk is transformed into an embedding using an embedding model.

3. **Vector Store Indexing**  
   Embeddings are stored and indexed in a vector database.

4. **Query Handling**  
   A user submits a question which is embedded and matched with relevant documents.

5. **Answer Generation**  
   The most relevant contexts are sent to the LLM to generate a fact-grounded response.
